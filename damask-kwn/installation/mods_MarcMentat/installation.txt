This is for the Linux64 version of Marc/Mentat

Refer to http://damask.mpie.de for complete installation instructions.

Usually you will need to be root for this to work!

See Marc and Mentat Release Guide for List of Build and Supported Platforms!

The Intel Fortran compiler needs to be installed.

1) Install Marc, Mentat and Documentation as usual
   Run the test example including subroutines to confirm that the installation of both Marc/Mentat and the Intel Fortran Compiler is ok!
2) Run the apply_DAMASK_modifications.py script from this directory.
