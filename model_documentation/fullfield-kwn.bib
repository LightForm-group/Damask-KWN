@article{Nicolas2003,
abstract = {This paper describes the response of a precipitate microstructure to various types of non-isothermal temperature changes, namely reversion, ramp heating and thermal cycles, met in heat-affected zones (HAZs) of arc-welds, in an Al-Zn-Mg alloy in the T6 and T7 states. During these thermal histories, the precipitate size and volume fraction are quantitatively measured by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Reversion experiments are characterised by a fast dissolution stage at almost constant average precipitate size, followed by a coarsening stage that affects the surviving precipitates. Ramp heating experiments show a dissolution behaviour, which is temporarily interrupted for low heating rates, either due to phase transition when the initial precipitates are of a metastable nature (the case of T6 initial state), or due to a dynamic competition between the average and critical radii during the temperature increase (the case of the T7 material). The HAZ of arc-welds is characterised by a gradual increase of the dissolved precipitate fraction as one gets closer to the weld line. In the zone immediately before complete dissolution, precipitate coarsening is observed. A simple model, based on the growth/dissolution of precipitates distributed in size classes, has been adapted to the present ternary alloy. This model, calibrated using the reversion experiments, has proven its predictive nature in all the other thermal cycles investigated (ramp heating and welding). The predictions of the model are used in order to improve the physical insight into the range of material behaviour observed in the experiments. {\textcopyright} 2003 Acta Materialia Inc.

abstract = {This article reviews continuum-based variational formulations for describing the elastic-plastic deformation of anisotropic heterogeneous crystalline matter. These approaches, commonly referred to as crystal plasticity finite-element models, are important both for basic microstructure-based mechanical predictions as well as for engineering design and performance simulations involving anisotropic media. Besides the discussion of the constitutive laws, kinematics, homogenization schemes and multiscale approaches behind these methods, we also present some examples, including, in particular, comparisons of the predictions with experiments. The applications stem from such diverse fields as orientation stability, microbeam bending, single-crystal and bicrystal deformation, nanoindentation, recrystallization, multiphase steel (TRIP) deformation, and damage prediction for the microscopic and mesoscopic scales and multiscale predictions of rolling textures, cup drawing, Lankfort (r) values and stamping simulations for the macroscopic scale. {\textcopyright} 2009 Acta Materialia Inc.},

@article{Roters2019a,
abstract = {Crystal Plasticity (CP) modeling is a powerful and well established computational materials science tool to investigate mechanical structure–property relations in crystalline materials. It has been successfully applied to study diverse micromechanical phenomena ranging from strain hardening in single crystals to texture evolution in polycrystalline aggregates. However, when considering the increasingly complex microstructural composition of modern alloys and their exposure to—often harsh—environmental conditions, the focus in materials modeling has shifted towards incorporating more constitutive and internal variable details of the process history and environmental factors into these structure–property relations. Technologically important fields of application of enhanced CP models include phase transformations, hydrogen embrittlement, irradiation damage, fracture, and recrystallization. A number of niche tools, containing multi-physics extensions of the CP method, have been developed to address such topics. Such implementations, while being very useful from a scientific standpoint, are, however, designed for specific applications and substantial efforts are required to extend them into flexible multi-purpose tools for a general end-user community. With the D{\"{u}}sseldorf Advanced Material Simulation Kit (DAMASK) we, therefore, undertake the effort to provide an open, flexible, and easy to use implementation to the scientific community that is highly modular and allows the use and straightforward implementation of different types of constitutive laws and numerical solvers. The internal modular structure of DAMASK follows directly from the hierarchy inherent to the employed continuum description. The highest level handles the partitioning of the prescribed field values on a material point between its underlying microstructural constituents and the subsequent homogenization of the constitutive response of each constituent. The response of each microstructural constituent is determined, at the intermediate level, from the time integration of the underlying constitutive laws for elasticity, plasticity, damage, phase transformation, and heat generation among other coupled multi-physical processes of interest. Various constitutive laws based on evolving internal state variables can be implemented to provide this response at the lowest level. DAMASK already contains various CP-based models to describe metal plasticity as well as constitutive models to incorporate additional effects such as heat production and transfer, damage evolution, and athermal transformations. Furthermore, the implementation of additional constitutive laws and homogenization schemes, as well as the integration of a wide class of suitable boundary and initial value problem solvers, is inherently considered in its modular design.},

@article{Militzer1994,
abstract = {The influence of deformation-induced excess vacancies on segregation and on precipitation is discussed within a phenomenological framework. During high temperature deformation, vacancies are mainly generated by the non-conservative movement of thermal jogs. Sinks for these vacancies are dislocations and grain boundaries. The excess vacancy concentration increases with strain rate and inverse temperature. Stronger effects are expected in f.c.c. materials because of their comparatively low diffusivities; in austenitic steels, the concentrations of deformation-induced vacancies are predicted to be significant, even at temperatures as high as 0.75 of the melting temperature. At the high strain rates ({\textgreater} 10 s-1) used in industrial rolling, the vacancy concentration may attain levels 2-3 orders-of-magnitude higher than the equilibrium one. One consequence of the presence of deformation-induced vacancies is the non-equilibrium segregation of boron observed e.g. in austenitic Nb-B steels, where it stimulates the nucleation of Nb borocarbonitrides. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

@article{Robson2020,
abstract = {Deformation introduces defects such as dislocations and excess vacancies that can strongly influence diffusion rates in aluminium alloys. This is of great importance in understanding the effect of deformation on processes such as precipitation hardening, which can be accelerated by orders of magnitude by the defects introduced. In this work, a simple and widely used classical model has been employed to explore the effect of process variables on diffusion enhancement due to deformation-induced excess vacancies and dislocations. It is demonstrated that in aluminium alloys, the strain rates and temperatures used in processing and testing encompass a range of regimes. At low strain rate or high temperature, a steady state becomes established in which the deformation enhancement depends on strain rate but not strain. Conversely, at high strain rate or low temperature, deformation enhancement is insensitive to strain rate but increases with strain. For all conditions, the effect of excess vacancies is much stronger than the direct effect of pipe diffusion along dislocations. The predicted deformation-induced vacancy concentration can exceed that expected after rapid quenching by an order of magnitude, but the lifetime of the deformation-induced vacancies is much shorter. Finally, limitations of the classical model and suggestions for improvement are proposed.},

@article{Murty1998,
abstract = {Critical strain to serrated flow in solid solution alloys exhibiting dynamic strain aging (DSA) or Portevin-LeChatelier effect is due to the strain-induced vacancy production. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques can be used to monitor in situ the dynamical behavior of point and line defects in materials during deformation, and these techniques are nondestructive and noninvasive. The new CUT-sequence pulse method allowed an accurate evaluation of the strain-enhanced vacancy diffusion and, thus, the excess vacancy concentration during deformation as a function of strain, strain rate, and temperature. Due to skin effect problems in metals at high frequencies, thin foils of Al were used and experimental results correlated with models based on vacancy production through mechanical work (vs thermal jogs), while in situ annealing of excess vacancies is noted at high temperatures. These correlations made it feasible to obtain explicit dependencies of the strain-induced vacancy concentration on test variables such as the strain, strain rate, and temperature. These studies clearly reveal the power and utility of these NMR techniques in the determination of deformation-induced vacancies in situ in a noninvasive fashion.},
